		<blockquote id="right">Hair colour is like a beautiful painting, reflecting light and shade with lots of dimension. It should be seamless and continually flow through the hair with perfect harmony. For every look, I work with the complexion, features, eye colour and natural texture accentuating the natural beauty. Great colour should always evolve with the client.</blockquote><cite>Vincent Nobile.</cite>
